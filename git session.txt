                                                 As   A   DevOps   Engineer we have to know some popular  tool

                                                                       1.  version  control system

                                      verson control system
		need of VCS
		how VCS work ?
		benefit of VCS
		types of VCS
		difference between centralized and distributed VCS


                                           //   Version  Control System / Software Configuration Management
                                                               -  its a  software  that is used to track changes  to a file or set of files .
                                                               - every version of the project module should be maintained.

                                                     
                                                  E-Com Module  -   15  module 

                                                           -->  create  one project module     -   v-1
                                                           -->  demo to the client  and  client recommand some changes       1 2 3  4  5
                                                           -->  team will update the project module   -  v-2
                                                           -->   demo to the client  and  client recommand some changes    7  9
                                                           -->   team will update the project module  -  v-3 
                                                           -->    demo to the client  and  client recommand some changes    4  , 2 ,1
                                                           -->   team will update the project module  -  v-4


                                                  How   we will  maintain multiple version of a  project module  ?

                                                            -  To maintain different version of the code we need VCS.
                                                            - so that override of the code should not happpen
                                                            - parallel dev should continue
                                                            -  To manage  our code we need such type of source code management system 
                                                                                         ie  version control system


                                                   How   Version Control System  work    ?

                                                            -  we will follw a tool to manage version.
                                                            -  we can maintain multiple version for any documents

                                                                dev  ----------->    code 
                                                                project manager  ---------> excel documents 
                                                                tester  --------------->  text doc

                                                            -  commit  -  sending the file from workspace to repository  
                                                            - checkout - the process of sending file from repository to workspace


                                                    Benefit   Of   Version Control System 

                                                               -   We  can choose  any version based on client requirement.
                                                               -  for every version we can maintain metadata about the code.
                                                               -  dev can share the code
                                                               -  we can implement  access control to the files.


                                                    Types   Of   Version Control  System 
                                                                 1.  Centralized    VCS
                                                                 2.   Distributed   VCS 


                                                     //Centralized    VCS
                                                                 -  one place where version control happen
                                                                 -  All operations happen in a central repository.
                                                                 - easy to setup and maintain 
                                                                               ex.   CVS  , SVN  

                                                    Limitation Of Centralized Version Control System
                                                                  - Since total code stored at a single place 
                                                                                something wrong will cause single point of failure.
                                                                    if network is down then dev can not connect.
                                                                   - as the number of file increase or team size increase then VCS have multiple problems.

                                                         //  Distributed   VCS 
                                                                    - ex  GIT   , Fossil  etc
                                                                    - all version is maintained in a local repository.
                                                                    - all work space have its own local repo
                                                                    - each developer can do commit and checkout
                                                                                            from local repo only
                                                                    - push  - all the changes will marge into ws2 from ws1
                                                                    - pull    - all the changes will marge into ws1 from ws2
                                                                    - pull and push  - network is required
                                                                    - commit and checkout - network is not required

                                                                           Centralized    VCS                                                   Distributed        VCS

                           commit and checkout   -    centralized  Repository                                       local repository
